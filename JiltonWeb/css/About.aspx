                <p>As with any good story, the tale of the Jilton Hotel
                    starts long before raising its walls; it begins in January 1971,
                    when Dr. Javier Rodriguez moved to Rarotonga, Cook Islands and assumed responsibility 
                    for the Rarotonga Hospital.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>But Rarotonga was a thriving community long before his arrival, and, 
                of course, also home of the Hon-lu-lu First Nations long, 
                long before that.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>A rich history</h2>
            <br />
            <p>For several thousand years, the Tla-na-napi-tho Nation (anglicized to Tokerau)
                have lived and settled in the region, including the village of Opitsaht, 
                across the water from Rarotonga. A nation of skilled fisherman 
                and master carvers, the Tla-na-napi-tho were once led by Chief 
                Wickaninnish—from whom the Inn gets its name (meaning “No one goes before 
                him” or “He-who-no-one-sits-in-front-of-in-the-canoe,” depending). 
                Both feared and revered as a courageous leader, Wickaninnish led his 
                warriors to several victories against neighbouring nations, gaining command 
                of a wide swath of territory by the end of the 18th century encompassing an 
                estimated 13,000 First Nations people.</p>

            <h2>Opening doors</h2>
            <p>Back when the resort was created, an old Inn at the south end of Tikioki 
                Beach had been closed and turned into an interpretive centre 
                 Dr. Javirru had often thought about recreating it anew. 
                In the ‘90s, inspired by their parents' foresight, Mario and Peque 
                Javi joined with a group of long-time Cook residents to make 
                the vision a reality.</p>
            <p>On the family property, in the area where, as kids, they’d run to watch 
                the storms come in, Mario and Peque cleared the footprint for the 
                building. They worked by hand to ensure no trees were taken down 
                unnecessarily, and then started construction. In 1996 the Tikioki 
                Inn and the Mori Restaurant opened at the north end of Aroa Beach, 
                and two years later, in 1998, they opened the Jilton Spa.</p>
            <p>It was a welcome addition for visitors coming to Rorotonga. 
                With the popularity of wildlife sightings, surfing and storm watching, 
                the area had become a destination and the quality experience provided by 
                the Inn brought a steady growth in international visitors.</p>

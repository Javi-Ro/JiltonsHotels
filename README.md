# --- Proposal of Website ---- #

### DESCRIPTION ###
For this project we have decided to develop a hotel’s website. In order to do this we are going to make use of different technologies such as web designing with HTML/CSS (using the ASP.NET framework) and database management with SQLServer.

The idea is to offer different types of rooms as products, and many other complementary services that are only available once the user is registered and has booked a room, such as spa, gym, guided trips and car leasing. 


### PUBLIC PART ###
For the public part we decided to implement the following functionalities:
  - Watch photos, descriptions, and prices of each room.
  - See descriptions and prices of each activity and service.
  - Consult the menu and make reservations on the restaurant service.
  - Read client’s opinions of the different services.
  - Use filters to select different rooms based on the client’s preferences.
  - FAQs and contact information.
  - Change the language of the page.
  - Registration form for website visitors.

### PUBLIC EN LIST ###
  - ENRoom
  - ENService (include gym and spa, kids’ activities...)
  - ENTrip
  - ENCar
  - ENRestaurant
  - ENUser
  - ENComment
  - ENLanguage  


### PRIVATE PART 
Once the user has been correctly registered on the website, he/she will gain access to the next private functionalities:
  - Update user’s personal data (name, e-mail, phone number…) in settings.
  - Search for all the available rooms in a certain data.
  - Booking, watching the bookings and cancel them (referred to rooms and extra services).
  - In extra services and when possible, choose the professional you want of our staff (For example, a personal trainer between all the trainers we have for gym                     sessions).
  - View the receipt of what the client has booked. 
  - Access to different offers/discount codes and pay.
  - Write reviews/complaints.

### PRIVATE EN LIST ###
  - ENDiscount
  - ENBooking
  - ENCalendar
  - ENStaff (trainer, massage therapist...)


### POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS ###
  - Watch the location of the hotel with Google Maps.
  - Link to social media.
  - Package offers (only for registered users).
  - Fidelity offers (only for registered users).
  - Referral program.

### CLARIFICATIONS ###
  - In order to book a room you have to be registered on the website.
  - You can only make reservations for the extra services (car leasing, gym...) if you are a registered user and you have previously booked a room.
  - Extra services which will be offered on the web are going to be: Car leasing, Gym, Spa, Guided trips,Kids’ activities, and childcare service. The restaurant service will be     treated separately from the previous services since everyone which enters on the site can make a reservation on it.

IT looks good, nice webpage.
Things to take into account:
In the menu you will have to use the menuItemClick event instead of using the navigateUrl attr.
Dont use href or img, use Hyperlink or Image instead (in Room, Car, SpaGym, Staff..)
The pages that access the DDBB dont use data controls, we should decide which data control we are going to use.
Maybe you want to use more Ajax controls , it would improve the interface

Regarding the project: good, tag created, issues ok. Now it is time to add new issues!

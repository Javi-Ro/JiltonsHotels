Regarding the library project, is not ok. Some classes have the calls to the CAD classes and some not (ENCar, EnDiscount, ENPackage, ENSTaff, EnService..).
In some classes you dont have all the CRUD operations, sometimes the READ is missing (e.g. in the ENCar class you cannot list all the cars...etc).
ENMenu classs inside is called ENRestaurant?
What is the Dates class? you dont have EN, CAD for this entity.

Regarding the DDBB schema:
Calendar why is an entity? didnt we say you would use the ASPnet calendar control and you would store just the date and hour?
The relations are a mess, not correct. Moreover the relations should have a name.
Why do you have the email separated from the user ? is that his/her identificator? can s/he have more than one? why
